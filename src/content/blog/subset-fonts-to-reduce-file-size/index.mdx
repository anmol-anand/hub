When building my directory <a href="https://catcafemap.com/cat-cafes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cat Cafe Map</a>, my goal was to keep the site as minimal and fast as possible—no bloated frameworks or unnecessary libraries that would slow down page loads.

I achieved this by statically rendering each page and only using vanilla JavaScript sparingly, thanks to [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands). The initial version shipped less than 10kb of JavaScript per page, but there was one annoying outlier: my `woff2` font file, weighing in at 33kb, was over three times the size of each page's JavaScript.

To optimize this, I added a build step to **subset the font** and only include the glyphs I actually needed. I wrote a simple Bash script that scanned the contents of the `dist` folder, extracted all the characters used across the site, and used `fonttools` to generate a trimmed-down font file containing only those glyphs.

The result? A **70% reduction in font size**, cutting it from 33kb down to just 10kb—a small but meaningful performance win that helps reduce server bandwidth and improve initial page loads.

Here’s a quick example of how I did it using **Bash, Python, and fonttools**:

```bash title="process-fonts.sh" caption="Creating font subsets via fonttools"
#!/bin/bash

# Check and install dependencies
check_and_install_dependencies() {
    # Check for pip
    if ! command -v pip &> /dev/null; then
        echo "pip is not installed. Please install Python and pip first."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check for fonttools and brotli
    if ! python3 -c "import fontTools" &> /dev/null || ! python3 -c "import brotli" &> /dev/null; then
        echo "Installing required Python packages..."
        pip install fonttools brotli
    fi
}

BUILD_DIR="./dist" # adjust this to your build directory
# Directory containing your fonts

# Output directory for subsetted fonts
SUBSET_DIR="./public/fonts"

# Create subset directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$SUBSET_DIR"

# Function to extract text content from files
extract_text() {
    # Extract text from HTML, JS, CSS files
    find "$BUILD_DIR" -type f \( -name "*.html" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css" \) -exec cat {} + | \
    # Remove HTML tags
    sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | \
    # Remove special characters but keep unicode
    tr -cd '[:alnum:][:space:][:punct:]\\u0080-\\uffff' | \
    sort -u > /tmp/text_content.txt
}

# Create subsets for each font
create_subset() {
    local font=$1
    local basename=$(basename "$font")
    local output="$SUBSET_DIR/${basename%.*}.subset.${basename##*.}"

    echo "Creating subset for $basename..."

        --layout-features='*' \
        --flavor=woff2 \
        --desubroutinize

    echo "Created subset font: $output"

    # Print size comparison
    original_size=$(stat -f %z "$font")
    subset_size=$(stat -f %z "$output")
    echo "Original size: $(($original_size/1024))KB"
    echo "Subset size: $(($subset_size/1024))KB"
    echo "Reduction: $((100-($subset_size*100/$original_size)))%"
}

    create_subset "$font"
done

```
